      Specific layouts of tall to shots buildings has a great affect on the availability of fresh air in cities, 
      the removal of pollution from cities is important because it can have negative health effects like 
      respiratory problems, it also improves quality of life by refreshing citizens' energy.

    	The layout and structure of cities have a significant impact on the air quality inside the city 
        ("the built environment has a more direct impact on morning pollutant concentrations, it also appears 
        to influence afternoon concentrations" <a href="#References">Liye Zhu. et al, (2021).</a>), smog is a more visual example of how 
        urban areas influence air quality ("it is prevalent in cities all over the world" <a href="#References">Fiona Green, (2025).)</a>. 
        Tall buildings (especially in series) diverge the air around them in a way that creates a circulating air 
        current on the back face ("it drives the air into the bottom of the model, forming a comparative weak 
        vortex" <a href="#References">Dan Mei. el al, (2018).</a>), this vortex is too weak to reach the street from most tall buildings so 
        pollutants diffuse into the atmosphere slower and lingers up to 10m above ground, which could potentially 
        cause smog as it is more likely to appear with higher exposure to sunlight, ("Sunlight causes volatile 
        organic compounds to react with nitrogen oxides to form ground-level ozone" <a href="#References">Fiona Green, (2025).</a>).

    <b>Height Arrangement</b>
	Aside from the negative health impacts of still, polluted air in urban areas, it can also cause an 
	unpleasant and musty smell alongside lower visibility. Hight and density of buildings is an important 
    	factor that contributes to the pollution residue at street level as winds struggle with reaching the 
    	bottom of buildings and spread greenhouse gasses away from the city. Figure 1 shows how arranging the 
        buildings in ascending order from the direction of the wind could help increase the availability of 
        new air at lower hights, this is because more buildings are able to interfere with the wind, and as the 
        wind can be modelled as a fluid, the area around the interference is affected less (but still noticeably), 
        therefore the other buildings would still experience airflow so more vortex's would be generated closer 
        to the ground. 
        A level hight arrangement is able to have some airflow between the buildings due to the same phenomenon 
        as your car humming with open windows on the motorway, however this is barely effective due to the hight
        of the buildings being the same and very little air being able to access lower areas of the building. 
        An even worse layout of buildings is in descending order facing the wind, this is because the tallest 
        building shields the others from the wind so few vortexes are able to be formed and the air between the 
        building would be mostly still.

    <b>Dangers of Pollution</b>
    	("exposure ambient air pollution with 3.68 million premature deaths each year" <a href="#References">World Health Organization, 
        (2021)</a>.), this is caused by an increased chance of leukaemia, Alzheimer’s disease and cancers of breast 
        tissue, prostate and lung tissues. (<a href="#References">National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, (2024)</a>). Air 
	pollution also is a contributor of breathing difficulties like asthma and emphysema, all these effects 
	significantly reduce the quality of life for many citizens. Reducing causes of long term health problems 
	would reduce the number of suffering families seeing their relatives endure through harsh periods of their 
	life.
        
    <b>Living Environment</b>
    	Increasing fresh air flow and therefore sunlight availability also makes all peoples day less gloomy. 
	More sunlight availability would increase the rate of photosynthesis from in city plant life, this 
	would make fresh oxygen more available to city folk, an increase in oxygen in the surrounding 
	atmosphere allows a higher concentration of oxygen to defuse into the blood due to the property of 
	haemoglobin, this has the effect of making all breathing beings (namely humans in this example) to 
	become less tired due to higher rates of respiration. This would allow for better productivity of workers 
    	and better mental health. 
        
    <b>Layout Solution</b>
        Using figure 3 we can see that a spacious layout allows for more airflow by a greater volume of air 
        flowing per top down area of the city, seen by the lack of lack of red areas in the diagram. Open areas 
        and clear pathways allow for greater airflow, we can use this to plan a cleaner city: 
	taller buildings should be built in the centre for airflow effectiveness seen in Figure 2 model b; 
	using shorter buildings to fill out spaces; 
	laying out the buildings in an even grid to reduce still air areas demonstrated by figure 3 type 3. 
	However at low density of buildings an uneven layout produces a more effective vortex, 
        ("The strength of the airflow inside the uneven street canyon models was obviously greater than that 
        of the airflow inside the even model under the steady inflow condition"<a href="#References"> Weijun Li. et al, (2020)</a>.), 
        therefore tall buildings should be separated in uneven "patterns". More open areas allow for more 
        sunlight inside the city, this could affect the city negatively if less airflow is available by 
        increasing the likelihood of smog due to nitrogenous pollutants reacting with sunlight to attach to 
        evaporated water molecules <a href="#References">Fiona Green, (2025).</a>).
